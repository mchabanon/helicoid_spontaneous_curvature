# helicoid_spontaneous_curvature

The Matlab code hel00_RUN.mat computes the spontaneous curvature at the edges of a helicoid and its bending energy for various inner ramp radii. It requires the accompagning comsol file (hel00.mph), Comsol Multiphysics version 5.3a or higher with the module "Chemical engineering", and must be ran within a "Comsol with Matlab" instance.

A sample data file where C_1=5C_0 (hel00_C1eq5_50iterations.mat) is provided for visualization (use visualization blocs at the end ofhel00_RUN.mat)
