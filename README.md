# helicoid_spontaneous_curvature


This code computes the spontaneous curvature at the edges of a helicoid and its bending energy for various inner ramp radii. It requires the accompagning comsol file (hel00.mph), Comsol Multiphysics version 5.3a or higher with the module "Chemical engineering", and must be ran with within a "Comsol with Matlab" instance.

This code was developed for the research article:
Chabanon M. & Rangamani P., "Geometric coupling of helicoidal ramps and curvature-inducing proteins in organelle membranes", Journal of the Royal Society Interface (2019).
